A "functional" summary of changes to the code base are placed in
this file. The complete set of change logs from Subversion can
be seen in ChangeLog. The section from just the latest release
can be seen in the main index.html bwctl documentation page in
the doc dir.

version 1.3
* Allows for different throughput testing tools. Currently supported are Iperf, Nuttcp and Thrulay (though Thrulay support is deprecated). Use the -T option on bwctl to specify which throughput testing tool to use. Use bwctl -h to see which are supported.
  * Some of the throughput test options are not available for some of the testers. BWCTL does not support UDP tests, changing the output format or changing the output units with either Nuttcp or Thrulay.
* Allows throughput tests to use multiple, parallel streams. This can be specified with the -P option in the bwctl client.
* Allows for UDP tests with bandwidth limits of higher than 4.3Gbps. This only works with 1.3 clients and servers.
* Allows for setting the output units for Iperf. Add "-f [iperf units]" to the bwctl command line to use it.
* Allows for comma-separated value output for Iperf. Add "-y c" to the bwctl command line client to use it.
* Allows BWCTL server administrators to define scripts to run at the completion of each test, allowing for results to be stored in a database, accounting tracking or any number of other tasks.
* Improves robustness of time/scheduling.
* Improves error handling of Iperf children processes.
* Improves error messages for failure conditions.

version 1.2a
* Added -f option to bwctld to allow it to run with root permissions.
* Added better usage() messages and more information to several
user prompts.
* Fixed uninitialized variable error that caused error returns from
the server to be incorrectly reported.
* Fixed srcnode bug.
* Ported to Solaris.
* Ported to OS X.
* Removed ntp system call dependancy.
* Increased default -L value for bwctl.
* Added message to data output to indicate that iperf was killed.
* Modified all config options to have '_' between words. (old
    versions are supported as well for now.)

version 1.1b
* bwctl now sets POSIXLY_CORRECT env var before calling getopt because
  Linux is too brain-dead to have a POSIX compliant getopt without it.
  (And I was too brain-dead to test it propely before releasing 1.1a.)

version 1.1a
* Added 3-party support.
* Added server-less client support.
* Enhanced auth model.
* Configurable ports for peer connections.
* Split access logging from error logging in bwctld.
* Support for TOS bits in tests.
* Modified scheduling algorithm to be more resilient to diverse
  delays from the client to the two servers. (Initial assumptions
  assumed the client was on one of the end-hosts - this is no
  longer the case.)
* Lots of internal clean-up - especially of the BWLAddr abstraction.
* Modified srcnode options to allow only a port specified. Now the port
  can be set while still wildcarding the address to all interfaces.

version 1.0e
* Corrected AES identity specified policies.
* Fixed bwctl -q flag.
* Corrected documentation of "assign user" lines in bwctld.limits.man
  (only one user can be specified per line.)
* Relaxed synchronization requirement and also added a syncfuzz option to
  the daemon to allow the sysadmin to relax the requirement even further.
* Lots of documentation edits for proper "English".

version 1.0c
* Fixed an optimization bug.
* Added more information to error messages if NTP state does not look correct.
* Modified time-stamp fetch routine to use the "offset" as reported by NTP.
* Added a small fixed offset so clocks don't have to be synced quite as close.

version 1.0b
* initial public release
