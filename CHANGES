A "functional" summary of changes to the code base are placed in
this file. The complete set of change logs from Subversion can
be seen in ChangeLog. The section from just the latest release
can be seen in the main index.html bwctl documentation page in
the doc dir.

version 1.3
* Auto-choose a common tool if none is specified by the user
* The ability to have a script execute after the daemon has finished
a session.
* Enable bandwidth limits of higher than 4.3Gbps (Note, this
only works with 1.3 clients and servers).
* Time/scheduling related changes to make it more robust
* Parallel streams
* CSV output
* Numerous minor bugfixes and cleanups

version 1.2a
* Added -f option to bwctld to allow it to run with root permissions.
* Added better usage() messages and more information to several
user prompts.
* Fixed uninitialized variable error that caused error returns from
the server to be incorrectly reported.
* Fixed srcnode bug.
* Ported to Solaris.
* Ported to OS X.
* Removed ntp system call dependancy.
* Increased default -L value for bwctl.
* Added message to data output to indicate that iperf was killed.
* Modified all config options to have '_' between words. (old
    versions are supported as well for now.)

version 1.1b
* bwctl now sets POSIXLY_CORRECT env var before calling getopt because
  Linux is too brain-dead to have a POSIX compliant getopt without it.
  (And I was too brain-dead to test it propely before releasing 1.1a.)

version 1.1a
* Added 3-party support.
* Added server-less client support.
* Enhanced auth model.
* Configurable ports for peer connections.
* Split access logging from error logging in bwctld.
* Support for TOS bits in tests.
* Modified scheduling algorithm to be more resilient to diverse
  delays from the client to the two servers. (Initial assumptions
  assumed the client was on one of the end-hosts - this is no
  longer the case.)
* Lots of internal clean-up - especially of the BWLAddr abstraction.
* Modified srcnode options to allow only a port specified. Now the port
  can be set while still wildcarding the address to all interfaces.

version 1.0e
* Corrected AES identity specified policies.
* Fixed bwctl -q flag.
* Corrected documentation of "assign user" lines in bwctld.limits.man
  (only one user can be specified per line.)
* Relaxed synchronization requirement and also added a syncfuzz option to
  the daemon to allow the sysadmin to relax the requirement even further.
* Lots of documentation edits for proper "English".

version 1.0c
* Fixed an optimization bug.
* Added more information to error messages if NTP state does not look correct.
* Modified time-stamp fetch routine to use the "offset" as reported by NTP.
* Added a small fixed offset so clocks don't have to be synced quite as close.

version 1.0b
* initial public release
