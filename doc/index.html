<i>BWCTL</i> is a command line client application and a scheduling and
policy daemon that wraps <b><a href="http://dast.nlanr.net/Projects/Iperf/">Iperf</a></b>.
<blockquote>From the <i>Iperf</i> web site:
<br><b>Iperf</b> is a tool to measure maximum TCP bandwidth, allowing the
tuning of various parameters and UDP characteristics. <b>Iperf</b> reports
bandwidth, delay jitter, datagram loss.</blockquote>
Currently <i>BWCTL</i> wraps <i>Iperf</i> by actually executing the <b>iperf</b>
command line program on the system. The <b>bwctl</b> client application
works by contacting a <b>bwctld</b> process on the remote system and on
the local system to requests that those daemons perform a specific <i>Iperf</i>
test between them. <b>bwctld</b> manages and schedules the resources of
the host it runs on. Therefore, it is necessary to contact a daemon on
the local host as well as the remote host to ensure more than one <i>Iperf</i>
process does not happen at the same time on the either host. A more detailed
description of the architecture is available in the <a href="architecture.html">architecture
documentation</a>.
<p>The <b>bwctl</b> client is used to request the type of <i>Iperf</i>
test wanted. Furthermore, it requests when the test is wanted. <b>bwctld</b>
either responds with a tentative reservation or a test denied message.
Once <b>bwctl</b> is able to get a matching reservation from both <b>bwctld</b>
processes (one for each host involved in the test), it confirms the reservation.
Then the <b>bwctld</b> processes run the test and return the results. The
results are returned to the client from both sides of the test. Additionally,
the <b>bwctld</b> processes share the results from their respective sides
of the test with each other.
<p><i>BWCTL</i> is used to enable non-specific <i>Iperf</i> tests to a
host without having to give full user accounts on the given system. Users
want the ability to run <i>Iperf</i> to determine the achievable or available
bandwidth between a pair of hosts. It is often useful to test to multiple
points along a network path to determine the network characteristics along
that path. Typically, users that want to do this path decomposition have
to directly contact the network/system administrators that control the
hosts along the path. The administrator needs to either run half of the
test for the user or give them a user account on the host. Also typically,
network paths of interest are usually controlled by multiple administrators.
These hurtles have made this kind of testing difficult in practice.
<p><i>BWCTL</i> was designed to help with this problem. It allows an administrator
to configure a given host as an <i>Iperf</i> endpoint that can be shared
by multiple users without concern that those users will interfere with
each other. Specific policy limits can be applied to specific users, and
individual tests are scheduled so they will not interfere with each other.
<i>BWCTL</i> allows the administrator to classify incoming connections
based upon a user name and AES key (generated by a pass phrase) combination
or alternatively based upon an IP/netmask. Once the connection is classified,
the <b>bwctld</b> can determine the exact type and intensities of <i>Iperf</i>
tests that will be allowed. (More details on the policy controls can be
found in the&nbsp; <a href="bwctld.limits.man.html">bwctld.limits(8)</a>
manual page.)
<h3>

<hr WIDTH="100%">Features</h3>

<ul>
<li>
Supports (and requires) versions 1.7.0 or 2.0.b of <b>Iperf</b>.</li>

<li>
Full IPv6 support. No options needed. If the target of a test is specified
by a DNS hostname, and that name has both an IPv4 and an IPv6 address defined,
the <b>bwctl</b> command line application prefers the IPv6 address.</li>

<li>
Data from both sides of the test is returned so that sending rate can be
compared with receiving rate.</li>

<li>
Port ranges for the tests can be specified to allow passive monitoring
to characterize the test streams more easily.</li>

<li>
Limits the types of <b>Iperf</b> tests that can be run. Simultaneous connections
are not supported. Sending a set amount of data is not supported because
<i>BWCTL</i>
needs to know how long the test will take before the test is started.</li>

<li>
Supports dynamic TCP window size determination. (Currently this is limited
in that the bottleneck capacity is specified as a constant in the config
file. This will most likely be determined dynamically using packet dispersion
techniques in the future.)</li>
</ul>

<h3>

<hr WIDTH="100%">Requirements</h3>

<ul>
<li>
<i>BWCTL</i> currently requires <b>Iperf</b> version 1.7.0 (or 2.0.b for
the adventurous).</li>

<li>
The
<b>bwctld</b> daemon requires a reasonably synchronized clock. It is
scheduling tests and needs to be sure it has the same idea of when a test
should take place as the peer system the test is being done with. Therefore,
<i>BWCTL</i> requires that <b>NTP</b> be running to synchronize the system
clock. This means that <b>NTP</b> needs to be setup correctly on the system
so that <b>NTP</b> can actually calculate a reasonable estimate of the
time error. For the <b>NTP</b> algorithms to work correctly, <b>NTP <font color="#FF0000">MUST</font></b><font color="#000000">
be configured with no fewer than 4 clocks.</font></li>

<li>
Additionally,
<i>BWCTL</i> uses the NTP specific system calls to fetch
time and time error estimates from the system kernel, so the kernel must
support these interfaces. (All modern UNIX systems support them.)</li>
</ul>

<h3>

<hr WIDTH="100%">Supported Systems:</h3>
<i>BWCTL</i> has been tested most extensively on FreeBSD 4.7 and Linux
2.4.20 but most recent versions of UNIX should work.
<h3>

<hr WIDTH="100%">Building the application</h3>
The <i>BWCTL</i> software uses the <i>gnu autoconf</i> tools to configure
the build process. <i>BWCTL</i> is distributed with a pre-built <b>configure</b>
script - so the actual <i>autoconf</i> tools should not be needed on the
target system. (<b>gnumake</b> may be required...) The <b>configure</b>
script can be run with the <i>--help</i> option to determine the full set
of configurable options.
<p>A basic build procedure would be:
<blockquote>
<pre>% gzip -cd bwctl-$VERS.tar.gz | tar xf -
% cd bwctl-$VERS
  # --prefix is only needed if you don't like the default
  #   (/usr/local on most systems)
% ./configure --prefix=/inst/root
% make
% make install</pre>
</blockquote>
Please report any build problems to <a href="mailto:bwctl-users@internet2.edu">bwctl-users@internet2.edu</a>.
<h3>

<hr WIDTH="100%">Configuring <i>bwctld</i></h3>
The basic procedure to configure <b>bwctld</b> is to create a <a href="bwctld.conf.man.html">bwctld.conf</a>
and optionally a <a href="bwctld.limits.man.html">bwctld.limits</a> and
<a href="bwctld.keys.man.html">bwctld.keys</a> file. These files need to
be installed in the same directory which is specified with the <b>-c</b>
option to <b>bwctld</b>.. The recommended directory is <i>/inst/root/etc</i>.
(The <i>etc</i> directory below your install root.) There are examples
of these files in the <i>bwctl-$VERS/conf&nbsp;</i> sub directory of the
distribution.
<p><b>bwctld.conf:</b>
<br>Used to configure basic operation of the daemon such as server listening
port, the path for <b>iperf</b>, and error logging. For a detailed description
of the options available see the <a href="bwctld.conf.man.html">bwctld.conf(8)</a>
manual page.
<p><b>bwctld.limits:</b>
<br>Used to configure the policy limits for the daemon. There are two parts
to this policy. 1) authentication. 2) authorization. The authentication
is done by assigning a class to each new connection. Each class has a set
of limits associated with it. The classes are hierarchical, so a connection
must pass the limit restrictions of the assigned class as well as all parent
classes. For a detailed description of the options available see the
<a href="bwctld.conf.man.html">bwctld.limits(8)</a>
manual page.
<p><b>bwctl.keys:</b>
<br>Used to associate identities with AES keys. These identities are then
mapped to a class by the <b>bwctld.limits</b> file. For a more detailed
description see the
<a href="bwctld.keys.man.html">bwctld.keys(8)</a> manual
page.
<h3>

<hr WIDTH="100%">Running <i>bwctld</i></h3>
The normal command-line to start the daemon is:
<blockquote>
<pre>&nbsp;% bwctld -c /inst/root/etc</pre>
</blockquote>
It is possible to run the daemon without a config file directory if enough
command-line options are specified, but it is easier to use a config file.
<p>To see all the available options:
<blockquote>
<pre>&nbsp;% bwctld -h</pre>
</blockquote>
More details on running the daemon as well as a complete description of
the command-line options is available from the <a href="bwctld.man.html">bwctld</a>
man page.
<h3>

<hr WIDTH="100%">Running <i>bwctl</i></h3>
The basic command line for the client is:
<blockquote>
<pre>% bwctl [options] [-c|-s] targethost</pre>
</blockquote>
The <i>-c</i> option indicates that the <i>targethost</i> should be an
<b>iperf</b>
client (sender). The <i>-s</i> option indicates the <i>targethost</i> should
be an <b>iperf</b> server (receiver). Currently <b>bwctl</b> only supports
one of these options at a time, with the other host assumed to be the localhost.
<p>To get the list of available options use:
<blockquote>
<pre>% bwctl -h</pre>
</blockquote>
More details on running the client application with a complete description
of all command-line options is available from the <a href="bwctl.man.html">bwctl</a>
man page.
