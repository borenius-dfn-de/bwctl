<h2>Time Synchronization</h2>

<p>BWCTL works best when the clocks of the clients and servers are synchronized. If the hosts are not synchronized, they might try to start begin tests at different times.</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.ntp.org/">NTP</a> is a protocol used to synchronize a
computer's clock to clocks available over a network. The NTP software is
available for, and often times, included with many operating systems. Most Unix
systems use the reference implementation of the software, and the example
included with this howto is geared to that version. 
</p>
<p>
Your NTP configuration should include between 4 and 7 NTP that it tries to
synchronize with. By including a number of servers, the NTP software can make
better decisions about which clocks are accurate and who it should trust for
time data. The hosts should be close to you, though this is not a hard
requirement. Ideally, the network paths to the servers should differ as much as
possible from each other.
</p>
<p>
There are a large number of public NTP servers that you can connect to. You can
find a list at <a
href="http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Servers/WebHome">ntp.org</a>. Internet2
maintains a set of NTP servers that you can use as well if you are connected to
the Internet2 network.
