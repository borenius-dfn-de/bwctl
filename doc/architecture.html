<i>BWCTL</i> works by having a <b>bwctld</b> process on each of the endpoint
test systems. The <b>bwctl</b> client contacts each of those daemons and
requests a test. That request includes an indication of the time period
that is wanted as well as a full parameterization of the <b>Iperf</b> test
that is wanted.
<p><b>bwctld</b> has been developed as a classic accept/fork daemon. The
master daemon process listens for new network connections and also manages
the resources for all child <b>bwctld</b> processes. Once a connection
comes in, <b>bwctld</b> forks a child process to handle that request. The
child process deals with all encryption and communication issues with the
client, as well as dealing with all <i>static</i> resource limits.&nbsp;
<i>Static</i> resource limits are the limits that are not dependent upon
what is currently happening on the node. i.e. The <i>request broker</i>
can easily determine if the given client is allowed to do UDP tests without
talking to the <i>master daemon</i>. Once the <i>request broker</i> process
determines the request is valid it makes are request to the <i>master daemon</i>
for the resources and time period requested by the client. If the <i>master
daemon</i> has the resources available (including the open time period)
it grants the request.
<p>The time period for the test is always requested by the client. It makes
a request to the <i>request broker</i> process on each endpoint of the
test in turn. The time period is requested by specifying two timestamps.
The earliest time and the latest time the client is willing to settle for.
The <i>request broker</i> returns a tentative reservation with the first
open time that will fulfill the parameters of the test, or a request denied
message. The client can then use the tentative reservation time as the
earliest time in the request to the <i>request broker</i> on the other
host. Eventually, an agreed upon time will be reached or the latest time
will be reached. If the <i>request broker</i> can not fulfill the request
before the latest time specified in the request it will return a server
too busy message. If the client gets the same time from both servers, it
must then confirm the reservation with a <b>start session</b> message within
a configurable timeout period at least before the reservation time.
<p>Once the client sends the the <b>start session</b> message, the <i>request
broker</i> forks off a <i>peer agent</i> that is responsible for verifying
the time offset to the other endpoint of the test and initializing the
communication socket that will be used to trade results of the test.
<p>If the test endpoint systems have a reasonably close idea of the time,
and they can communicate, the <i>peer agent</i> forks off the <i>test process</i>.
The <i>test process</i> waits until the scheduled start time and then executes
<b>iperf</b> with the correct command-line. (Experience is showing that
a closer integration with the testing process (<b>iperf</b>) may be needed
in the future.)
<p>The image above shows a dashed blue line around the processes that occur
on each host. Currently the client is constrained to one of the given hosts,
but that is a limitation that is likely to go away. (This will probably
only be available for AES authenticated requests. If this is done for IP/netmask
authenticated transactions it opens <i>BWCTL</i> up as a likely target
to generate DOS attacks.)
